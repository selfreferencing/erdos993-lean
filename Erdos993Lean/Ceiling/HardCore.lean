# The hard-core mean, the occupation bound B5, and the activity-indexed form R221A

Definitions only; the theorems that use them are in `Ceiling/Join.lean`.

For a finite forest `F` on `n` vertices with independence counts `i_k`:

* `partitionFn F λ = Z_F(λ) = ∑_k i_k λ^k` (the independence polynomial at the activity `λ`);
* `hardCoreMean F λ = μ_F(λ) = λ Z_F'(λ) / Z_F(λ) = ∑_k k i_k λ^k / ∑_k i_k λ^k`, the mean size of
  an independent set drawn from the hard-core model at activity `λ`;
* `matchingEnvelopeMean F = W(F) = n/2 − ν(F)/3`, with `ν` the matching number
  (`matchingNumber`, `Ceiling/Statement.lean`); `W(F)` is the mean of `B_F(x) = (1+2x)^ν(1+x)^(n−2ν)`
  normalized at activity 1;
* `numComponents F = cc(F)`, the number of connected components, isolated vertices included.

**B5, occupation at activity 7/3** (`OccupationAt73`; campaign R212, Appendix R3, file
`ProofRuns/2026-09-21_overnight_record_law/K2_RETURN/K2_ceiling_proof.md`, lines 1301–1429; audit
review J6): `μ_F(7/3) ≥ W(F) + cc(F)/7` for every forest.  A paper proof with a finite check of 428
exact integer cases; stated here as a proposition.

**R221A, the activity-indexed form of the ceiling's analytic input** (`R221A`; ledger A2288,
adopted; scope review `ProofRuns/2026-09-24_night_B/REVIEWS_R221_SCOPE/R221_SCOPE_REVIEW.md`): for
every forest with `n ≥ 8,400,000`, every activity `λ ∈ [1/3, 7/3]` and every integer `k` with
`|k − μ_F(λ)| < 1`: `i_{k−1}, i_k, i_{k+1} > 0` and `i_k² > exp(1/(1650 n)) i_{k−1} i_{k+1}`.  This is
the output of the campaign's computer-assisted analytic proof (Fourier inversion with an exact
rational error ledger at `n = 8.4·10^6`, checker `K2_R13_checker.py`); **it is not proved in Lean**.
It is stated here for integers `k ≥ 1` (for `n ≥ 8.4·10^6` every `k` within distance 1 of
`μ_F(λ) ≥ λn/(1+3λ) ≥ n/6` is at least 1, so nothing is lost).
