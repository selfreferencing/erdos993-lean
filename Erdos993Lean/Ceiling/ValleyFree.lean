# The valley-free window lemma

Sources: T. Zhang, *Exact Certificates for Unimodality of Forest Independence Polynomials*, v1.1,
§5.3 (stitching the prefix, the window and the tail); the Zhang proof map's §5, consequence 4
(campaign `ProofRuns/2026-09-27_zhang_review`); campaign `ProofRuns/2026-09-28_analytic_large_n`,
lane A5.

The ceiling's assembly `unimodal_of_prefix_window_tail` (`Ceiling/Statement.lean`) needs
log-concavity with positive entries across the window.  The analytic route for forests with at
least 61 vertices delivers less at each window rank `k`: **no weak valley**, i.e. never
`a k ≤ a (k − 1)` together with `a k ≤ a (k + 1)`.  This is enough:

* `no_descent_then_ascent`: under the three hypotheses below, a strict descent at `i` is never
  followed by a strict ascent at some `j > i`;
* `unimodal_of_prefix_valleyFree_tail`: a sequence that is nondecreasing up to `L`, has no weak
  valley at any rank `k` with `L < k < U`, and is nonincreasing from `U` on is unimodal.

Proof.  Given a strict descent at `i` and a strict ascent at `j > i`, the prefix forces `L ≤ i`
and the tail forces `j < U`; the first `k > i` with `a k ≤ a (k + 1)` satisfies `k ≤ j` and
`a k < a (k − 1)`, a weak valley with `L < k < U`.  Hence the sequence is nondecreasing before its
first strict descent (or before `U`, if that comes first) and nonincreasing from there on.
