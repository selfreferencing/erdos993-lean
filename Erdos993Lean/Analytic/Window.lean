# Exact activity selection at the interior window ranks (open object O6, option (b))

Campaign `ProofRuns/2026-09-28_analytic_large_n`, lane A5; interface `Analytic/Defs.lean`.
Sources: the ceiling's join lemmas B2 and B7 (`Ceiling/Join.lean`; campaign R212, Appendix R) and
the occupation bound B5 (`occupationAt73`, `Ceiling/Occupation/Main.lean`), which fixes the top
activity of the route at `7/3`.

The analytic route excludes a weak valley at a window rank `k` by looking at the hard-core model
at an activity `t` whose mean is exactly `k`.  For every interior window rank
`⌈n/4⌉ < k < h_B` such an activity exists, strictly inside `(1/3, 7/3)`:

* `exists_activity_eq`: `μ_F(1/3) ≤ n/4 < k` (B2); `k + 1 ≤ h_B ≤ ⌈(3n − 2ν)/6⌉` (B7, with
  `2ν ≤ n`) gives `6k + 1 ≤ 3n − 2ν`, so `k < W = n/2 − ν/3 ≤ W + cc/7 ≤ μ_F(7/3)` (B5); the
  intermediate value theorem on `[1/3, 7/3]` (continuity of `μ_F`) gives `t` with `μ_F(t) = k`,
  and `t` lies in the open interval because both end inequalities are strict.
* `exists_activity_inRange`: the same activity satisfies `InRange t`, `0 < t` and
  `AtInteriorRank F t`, the form consumed by the inputs O1–O5 of `Defs.lean`.

Compare `Join.exists_activity_near` (the ceiling's B8), which covers the closed window
`⌈n/4⌉ ≤ k ≤ h_B` but only places `k` within distance one of a mean.
