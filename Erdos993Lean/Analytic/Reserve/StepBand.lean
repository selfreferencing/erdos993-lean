# The step certificate on a band of `Reserve/Defs.lean` (lane A11)

Campaign `ProofRuns/2026-09-28_analytic_large_n` (Lean lane A11).  Sources: Astra's
`TWO_GENERATION_RESERVE_PROOF.md`, `SHARP_FIRST_FOUR_RESERVE_PROOF.md`,
`LOWER_SHARP_ALTERNATE_PROOF.md` (snapshot `LEAN/referee/astra_o1/snapshot_0730`) and the referee's
`LEAN/referee/REVIEW_ASTRA_O1_PROOF.md`.

The four bands of `Reserve/Defs.lean` use the reserve `α y + γ u²/y` (`β = 0`).  Here the three
numeric obligations of the interface are turned into the per-activity step certificate of
`Reserve/Step.lean`:

* `compOK_of_box_tail`: `CompOK` at every feasible point `(λ, T, Y)` of the band, from the finite
  box `BoxOK` (`T ≤ 6`, `Y ≤ 4`) and the analytic tails `TailOK` (`Y ≥ 4` or `T ≥ 6`);
* **`stepCert_of_band`**: for `λ` in the band, `StepCert` with `α = alpha c λ`, `β = 0`,
  `γ = gamma c λ`, `A = capA c λ`: at `β = 0` the comparison CC is `α E` (nonnegative by
  `EntropyOK`), CB is `compC` (nonnegative by (QC), or by `L ≥ 0` with `Z > 0`), BC is `compB`
  ((QB)), and the selected-leaf base is `LeafOK` (`A q − q(1 − q) = D q²`);
* for a signed reserve (the upper band, not in the interface yet): `compCC_nonneg_of_entropy`, CC
  from the Pinsker part of `EntropyOK` and `β² T ≤ 8 α Z`.

Scalarity: `E` (the entropy coefficient of one parent–child message pair, `EntropyOK`), `Z`, `L`,
`H`, `J` are local coefficients of one parent–child quadratic; `T` and `Y` are the grandchild and
child log-mass sums of the actual rooted tree.  They are consumed by `reserve_step_cert`.
