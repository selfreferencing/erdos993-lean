# The conditional top theorem of the analytic route (skeleton form)

Campaign `ProofRuns/2026-09-28_analytic_large_n`, lane A5; interface `Analytic/Defs.lean`.
Sources: T. Zhang, *Exact Certificates for Unimodality of Forest Independence Polynomials*, v1.1:
Theorem 2.1 (forests with at most 60 vertices, `Zhang.Rows.finite60_of_certificates`), (45)–(50)
(the conditional binomial mixture over a maximum-weight independent set) and §5.3 (stitching);
the campaign reports `ProofRuns/2026-09-27_zhang_review/reports/T1.md` (the no-valley lemma) and
`T23.md` (the forest inputs).

* `unimodal_of_noWeakValley_window`: the combinatorial assembly for one forest.  The rising prefix
  L394 below `⌈n/4⌉`, the tail B6 against `B_F` from `h_B` on (as in `ceiling_of_R221Inputs`), and
  no weak valley at the interior ranks `⌈n/4⌉ < k < h_B` give a unimodal independence sequence
  (`unimodal_of_prefix_valleyFree_tail`).
* `noWeakValley_of_analytic_inputs`: for a forest with `n ≥ 61`, the mixture facts
  (`MixtureFacts`) and the inputs O1–O5 (`AnalyticInputs P`) exclude a weak valley at every interior
  rank `k`.  Select `t ∈ (1/3, 7/3)` with `μ_F(t) = k` (`exists_activity_eq`, B5), a maximum-weight
  independent set `B`, the mixture `X = forestMixture F B t` and `m = E M`.  The hypotheses of
  `NoValleyAt (actQ t) m θ D T M1` hold: `X` is a probability mixture, `E δ = 0`,
  `E δ² = V − q(1 − q) m ≤ θ q(1 − q) m` (O2 with `q m = W`), `Var M ≤ D m` (O1), the tails (O3);
  `m ≥ mfloor(t)` (O5) places `m` in the domain of the no-valley property (O4).  The
  weak-valley translation (`not_valley_of_not_weakValley`, with `MixtureFacts.prob_eq`) moves the
  conclusion to the counts.
* `erdos993_of_analytic_inputs_pending`: Erdős #993 from `MixtureFacts`,
  `Zhang.Cert.CertificatesSound` and `AnalyticInputs P` for a profile `P` (forests with at most 60
  vertices by Zhang's finite part, the others by the two results above).

Scalarity check: the numerical parameters are the fields of the profile `P`, evaluated at the
selected activity `t` and at `m = E M` of the forest mixture: `θb t` summarizes the second moment of
`δ` (produced by O2, consumed by O4/T1), `Db t` the variance of the free count `M` (O1 → O4/T1),
`Tb t m` and `M1b t m` the lower tail of `M` below the cutoff (O3 → O4/T1), `mfloor t` the expected
free count `m` (O5 → O4).  Nothing else is carried between the steps.

/-- **The combinatorial assembly for one forest.**  If the independence sequence of `F` has no weak
valley at any interior window rank `⌈n/4⌉ < k < h_B`, it is unimodal: the rising prefix L394 covers
the ranks below `⌈n/4⌉`, the tail inequality B6 against the row `B_F` covers the ranks from `h_B`
on, and `unimodal_of_prefix_valleyFree_tail` stitches them. -/
