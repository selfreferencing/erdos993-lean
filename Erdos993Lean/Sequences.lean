# Sequence predicates

Unimodality, log-concavity and "no internal zeros" for sequences `ℕ → ℕ`, and the classical
implication: a finitely supported log-concave sequence with no internal zeros is unimodal.

These are the predicates used by every headline theorem of the package.  They are stated for
`ℕ`-valued sequences because the headline objects are counts of independent sets.

another strict decrease.) -/
