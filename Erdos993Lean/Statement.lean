# The Erdős #993 statement

The definitions `FiniteForest`, `UnimodalUpTo`, `independenceCount`, `independenceNumber`,
`independenceSequenceUnimodal` and `Erdos993Statement` reproduce, with the same semantics, the
campaign's pinned statement `Lean993.Erdos993Statement` (file `Lean993/Statement.lean` of the
campaign repository, pinned 2026-08-16): forests are simple graphs on `Fin n` satisfying Mathlib's
`SimpleGraph.IsAcyclic`, independent sets are counted with Mathlib's `indepSetFinset`, and
unimodality is weak unimodality up to the independence number.

Erdős Problem #993 asks whether `Erdos993Statement` holds.  On the branch `analytic-route` of this
repository it is proved with no hypotheses: `Erdos993Lean.Analytic.erdos993 : Erdos993Statement`
(`Erdos993Lean/Analytic/Erdos993.lean`; see `README.md` and `WHAT_WE_DID.md`).

This file also records the bridge from the package's own sequence predicates
(`Erdos993Lean.Unimodal`) to `UnimodalUpTo`.
